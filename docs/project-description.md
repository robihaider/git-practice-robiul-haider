This project is created to practice Git and GitHub including branching, merging, deleted and commits.
# Project Description

This project was created as part of a practical assignment to learn and demonstrate
core concepts of **Git** and **GitHub** version control.

The main goal of this project is to practice real-world Git workflows, including
repository creation, local initialization, structured commits, branching, merging, branch deleted
and pushing code to a remote GitHub repository.

## Objectives
- Understand how Git works locally
- Practice creating and managing commits
- Learn to work with multiple branches
- Merge feature branches into the main branch
- Maintain a clean and organized project structure
- Push and manage a public repository on GitHub

## Project Features
- A simple Python program that prints the author's name and the current date
- A basic calculator module with:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division with basic error handling
- Proper use of `.gitignore` to avoid unnecessary files
- Clear commit messages following best practices

## Git Workflow Used
1. Repository initialized locally using Git
2. Files added and committed incrementally
3. Feature branches created for new functionality
4. Feature branches merged into the main branch
5. Final project pushed to GitHub as a public repository

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete beginner-friendly Git and GitHub workflow.
It helps build confidence in version control usage and prepares the developer
for collaborative software development environments.
